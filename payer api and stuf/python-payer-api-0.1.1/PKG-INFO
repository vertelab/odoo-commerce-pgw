Description: Python Payer API
        ================

        Python package for interacting with the `Payer <http://payer.se>`__
        payments API.
        
        The scope of this module is basically to serialize the data into XML
        ready for transmitting to Payer. Given order details, billing details
        and callback URLs it will build an XML tree, encode it according to the
        Payer specifications and return the encoded data along with the required
        key-value pairs in a dict. Payer expects this data in a POST request
        using an ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` content type.
        
        Generating HTML, providing any type of request handlers or views needed
        for a successful payment procedure however, is outside the scope of this
        module. Such implementations are encouraged to be realized as
        independent modules, in relation to the frameworks, webshop modules etc.
        that you may be using. One such example is
        `django-shop-payer-backend <https://github.com/dessibelle/django-shop-payer-backend>`__
        for which python-payer-api was initially developed.

            print api.get_post_data()
        
        Payment Process
        ---------------
        
        The main flow of the payment process is as follows:
        
        1. Initialize a ``PayerPostAPI`` object using the Agent ID, Key 1 and
           Key 2 values supplied by Payer. Optinally set ``test_mode`` and
           ``debug_mode`` and add a list of ``payment_methods``.
        2. Create a ``PayerProcessingControl`` object and add it to your API
           object using the ``set_processing_control()`` method. This object
           holds four URL's that your site has to provide. They are:
            
           ``success_redirect_url``: A "thank you" URL, displayed after
           completed purchase
           ``authorize_notification_url``: A callback URL, described below,
           called when orders are authorized.
           ``settle_notification_url``: A callback URL, described below, called
           when orders are payed.
           ``redirect_back_to_shop_url``: A "cancel" or "back to shop" URL.
            
        3. Create a ``PayerOrder`` object (including ``PayerBuyerDetails`` and
           ``PayerOrderItem`` objects) and add it to your API object using the
           ``set_order()`` method.
        4. You can now call ``api.get_post_data()`` for a dict of the query
           parameters Payer expects. Add them as ``<input type="hidden">``
           elements in a ``<form>`` element with method ``POST`` and action
           ``api.get_post_url()`` and have the user submit the form (i.e. needs
           to happen in front-end).
        5. Payer will parse your order, and once the payment has been completed
           Payer will perform a GET request to your callback URL's - the
           ``authorize_notification_url`` URL, and depending on payment method
           (direct / invoice) call the ``settle_notification_url`` URL. You will
           want to implement a view or URL handler that listens on these URL's,
           for which you call the ``validate_callback_ip()`` and
           ``validate_callback_url()`` methods on PayerPostAPI. A couple of
           query parameters will be appended to the callback URL's, from which
           you can extract the Order ID, selected payment method, payment ID
           etc. The complete list of query paramters are:
            
           ``order_id``, ``payer_callback_type``, ``payer_testmode``,
           ``payer_payment_type``, ``payer_added_fee``,
           ``payer_merchant_reference_id``, ``payer_payment_id``,
           ``payread_payment_id``.
            
           Depending on the validity of the requests, your view should return
           either ``TRUE`` or ``FALSE`` using a ``text/plain`` content type.
        6. Once Payer has performed its auth and settle validation it will
           redirect the user the the ``success_redirect_url`` URL.
